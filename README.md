# QuantizationVisualization
Here's an implementation of generalized Otsu algorithm in C++ and an extension in Python to visualize the result of the algorithm.
The algorithm can potentially be extended on 3D color space (RGB). 
The visualisation can be improved by generating a separate image for each step of the algorithm.
